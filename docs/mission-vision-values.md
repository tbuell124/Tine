# Mission, Vision, and Values

## Mission
Tine exists to make every musician's live performance smoother, calmer, and more connected. We design tools that remove friction from the on-stage tuning workflow so artists can focus on expression rather than troubleshooting.

## Vision
We envision a world where every performer walks on stage knowing their sound will be dialed in instantly. Our goal is to become the trusted companion for tuning and tone preparation, delivering effortless accuracy through beautifully restrained interfaces and dependable technology.

## Values
- **Musician-Centered Design**: We observe real stage scenarios and let working artists guide our priorities. Every interaction is evaluated by how it feels in the hands of a performer under lights and time pressure.
- **Clarity and Calm**: Our products embrace minimalist visuals, gentle motion, and purposeful feedback to reduce cognitive load in high-energy environments.
- **Precision With Empathy**: We blend rigorous signal processing with subtle haptic and visual cues so players experience both technical accuracy and reassuring guidance.
- **Reliability Under Pressure**: We build for the unpredictable realities of live showsâ€”variable acoustics, quick changeovers, and limited rehearsal time.
- **Continuous Refinement**: We iterate relentlessly based on musician feedback, measuring success by how naturally our tools disappear into the flow of performance.
