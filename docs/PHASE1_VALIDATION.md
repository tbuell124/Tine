# Phase 1 Validation – Two Wheels, One Alignment Moment

## Objective
Phase 1 focused on shipping an interactive visual prototype of the dual-wheel tuner interface so that gesture handling, Skia rendering, and Expo wiring could be evaluated on target devices before deeper DSP work begins. The README describes the product vision as a precision tuner featuring concentric wheels, GPU-accelerated visuals, and React Native + Expo foundations.

## Scope Reviewed
- Source TypeScript/TSX files (no binary assets were included in this review)
- Expo configuration and dependency manifest that enable the prototype app to run
- Supporting hooks that power the canvas interactions

## Findings
1. **Expo app shell is in place** – `App.tsx` renders the interactive orb inside a gesture-handler root, matching the prototype scope and using Expo status bar utilities for platform parity.
2. **Skia-driven interactive wheel exists** – `src/components/InteractiveOrb.tsx` implements a Skia `Canvas` with a draggable gradient orb, wired to pan gestures via Reanimated. This satisfies the visual feedback goal outlined for the first milestone.
3. **Reusable state hook for canvas primitives** – `src/hooks/useSkiaCircle.ts` encapsulates the mutable values needed to drive the Skia circle, keeping the component tree lean and testable.
4. **Project metadata reflects tuner vision** – The root `README.md` documents the tuner concept, outlines future audio/DSP work, and provides setup instructions for developers, demonstrating that foundational documentation shipped with the prototype.
5. **Expo assets placeholder guidance** – `assets/README.md` calls out required image assets without committing binaries, honoring the repository policy to exclude binary files while keeping the project buildable once art is supplied.

## Conclusion
All deliverables planned for Phase 1—the interactive tuner wheel prototype with gesture support, Skia rendering, and project documentation—are present in the repository. The codebase is ready to progress into Phase 2 tasks such as audio capture, pitch detection, and the full dual-wheel visualization.

## Recommended Next Steps
- Implement the microphone input pipeline and wire it into the UI state.
- Begin integrating DSP utilities (YIN/MPM) to convert captured audio into pitch data.
- Expand automated testing (unit + lint/type checks) to cover new logic introduced in upcoming phases.
