Tine quick fixes
================

This archive includes:
- tine-fixes.patch : unified diff to apply to your repo root
- assets/favicon.png : placeholder favicon referenced by app.json
- HOWTO.txt : these instructions

Apply the patch:
  git apply tine-fixes.patch

If you don't use git, manually:
  1) Replace babel.config.js with the version in the patch (adds module-resolver and gates Reanimated to Metro).
  2) Ensure app.json has "web.favicon": "./assets/favicon.png" and does NOT list "react-native-reanimated/plugin" under plugins.
  3) Drop assets/favicon.png into your project's ./assets folder.
  4) (Optional) Use "npm run start:sim" to launch Metro on localhost for the iOS Simulator.

Then do:
  rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json .expo
  npm install
  npx expo start -c --host=localhost
  (press "i" to open iOS, or run: xcrun simctl openurl booted "exp://127.0.0.1:8081")
