# Source Structure

This directory houses the application code organized into feature-focused modules:

- `components/` – Shared UI building blocks and reusable presentation logic.
- `hooks/` – Custom React hooks that encapsulate stateful behavior or data fetching.
- `native/` – Platform-specific implementations and React Native bindings.
- `utils/` – Framework-agnostic helpers, formatters, and pure utility functions.

Each folder currently contains a `.gitkeep` placeholder so that the structure is versioned until concrete implementations are added.
